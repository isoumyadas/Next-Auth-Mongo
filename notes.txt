How verify token & forgot pass works?
    1. generates token and the expiry
    2. saves in DB and sends to user via email (for verification)
    3. When user clicks on the link
        3.1 query runs to check if user clicked token and db stored token is same? if yes then user is verified  : if no then user is not verified
        3.2 same for time too.
    4. Same is also done with forgotPassword
