How verify token & forgot pass works?
    1. generates token and the expiry
    2. saves in DB and sends to user via email (for verification)
    3. When user clicks on the link
        3.1 query runs to check if user clicked token and db stored token is same? if yes then user is verified  : if no then user is not verified
        3.2 same for time too.
    4. Same is also done with forgotPassword


// What to use redirect or router?

- You should use the redirect function for server-side redirects and the useRouter hook for client-side navigation.
- A server-side redirect causes a full page reload, while client-side navigation with useRouter provides a smooth, app-like transition without a reload.


redirect useCases:
- Server Components, Route Handlers, Server Actions, getServerSideProps.
- Enforcing rules, like authentication. Handling server-side form submissions.

useRouter() hook useCases:
- Client Components ("use client") only
- Navigating programmatically after a user action (e.g., login button click).

import useRouter hook from next/navigation because next/router was used for page router and next/navigation is used for App Router.


// What does dynamic routes mean?
=> ex: in profile we have another folder named as [userId], this mean /profile/..., whatever route you have put is known as dynamic route

```      <Link href={`/profile/${data}`}>{data}</Link>              ```
